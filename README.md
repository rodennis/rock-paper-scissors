This project has been a serious challenge. I started out with trying to make it more simple than it actually had to be
i started out naming my variables of computerSelection and playerSelection, but the thing i did wrong was setting them
inside of a function. i would later find out that i was trying to access a variable inside a function from another function.
I also was not calling my functions properly, at the correct time. I had my base if statement set up correctly, but was 
not executing the code. After changing my variables that i had set inside functions to just variables I was able to access
them within my startRound function. At that point i was only getting a "its a draw" everytime i input and answer. That was 
i had my else statement set to a declaremen "that if blank didnt  = blank then to do this". when I already declared what i 
wanted my code to do earlier and then if and only if it wasnt true then it would do what i stated in the else statement.





Things i have learned from this project. 
1. functions need to be called by just their nameholder.
2. functions cannot call a variable from inside another function.
3. variables do not have to be nested inside functions 
4. only nest a variable inside a funtion if you only plan to use that variable inside that function.
5. the prompt function needs to be set to a variable for the answer to be stored otherwise the answer goes nowhere,
which you then in return call that function which uses the stored answer from the prompt.
6. else statements dont have to have a declaration, they just need to be set to a statement.
